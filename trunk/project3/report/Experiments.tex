\section{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}

We solved all the $77$ problems. The first figure \ref{fig:nback} shows the number of backtrackings for each problem. The ``naked triple (double)'' strategy exhibits impressive performance in constraint propagations. Without such kinds of rules, there are $1/4$ problems need to use backtracking, no matter pick the most constrained slot or pick slot randomly. Meanwhile, only $2$ or $3$ problems require backtracking for the ``naked triple'' case.

Next we show the problem completion in each difficulty level in table \ref{tab:dif}. From this table, we can see that the annotation for each problem are corrected approximately, except $3$ evil problems which were solved by only simple rules. For comparing the effectiveness of most constrained slot heuristic and random slot heuristic, we make the same experiment with random slot heuristic, which placed in last 4 rows in table \ref{tab:dif}. It seems these two heuristics are getting same results. We will further do experiments for this comparison on number of rules. For justifying the difficulty of problems, the average number of filled-in numbers are concerned, as shown in table \ref{tab:fill}.

    \caption{Number of complete problems in different combinations of rules. The default heuristic is the most constrained slot. However, it seems picking most constrained slot or picking random slot is the same in this case. Here, r1: rule 1, r1,2: rule1 + rule2, n2: naked double, n3: naked triple, n2,3: n2 + n3.}\label{tab:dif}

The number of rules being used is an important factor, we also use it to estimate the difficulty of a problem and show the average number of different kinds of rules used for each set of problems. The results is shown in table \ref{tab:rule}. The trendency is clear that more hard problems requires more number of rules. Note that for this experiment we use the combination of all rules and backtracking for making sure every problem can be solved.

\end{table}

We further compare with two heuristics in the number of rules being taken. Figure \ref{fig:heu} shows all pair of comparisons. By applying these two heuristics, a problem uses more or less the same number of rules. This is consistent with our experiment in number of complete problems.
