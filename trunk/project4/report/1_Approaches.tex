\section{Approaches}\label{sec:approaches}

\subsection{Simulator}

We used the simulator for Python provided by Walker Orr. While the simulator represented the Wumpus world fairly well as described in the textbook, it was still incomplete. The simulator lacked the notion of facing directions as well as the percepts bump and scream. Therefore, we modified the simulator to add these remaining percepts and fixed the simulator to keep track of facing direction. The modified simulator should represent the Wumpus world as described in the textbook.

\subsection{Algorithm}

We implemented the algorithm in the textbook (pg. 270, fig. 7.20).
