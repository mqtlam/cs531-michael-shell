\section{Discussion}

We discuss our results and answer the questions in this section.

1. Show an example solution sequence for each algorithm for the largest size you tested

For size $n = 10$ and A* on problem "7126049853":



For size $n = 10$ and RBFS on problem "7126049853":

[7126049853,\_,\_], [126049853,7,\_], [26049853,17,\_], [6049853,217,\_], [049853,6217,\_], [49853,06217,\_], [9853,406217,\_], [853,9406217,\_], [53,89406217,\_], [3,589406217,\_], [\_,3589406217,\_], [3,589406217,\_], [\_,3589406217,\_], [3,589406217,\_], [\_,3589406217,\_], [3,589406217,\_], [\_,3589406217,\_], [3,589406217,\_], [53,89406217,\_], [53,9406217,8], [53,406217,98], [3,5406217,98], [3,406217,598], [3,06217,4598], [\_,06217,34598], [0,6217,34598], [0,217,634598], [0,17,2634598], [10,7,2634598], [210,7,634598], [210,67,34598], [3210,67,4598], [43210,67,598], [543210,67,98], [6543210,7,98], [76543210,\_,98], [76543210,9,8], [876543210,9,\_], [9876543210,\_,\_]

2. Is there a clear preference ordering among the heuristics you tested considering the number of nodes searched and the total CPU time taken to solve the problems for the two algorithms?

3. Can a small sacrifice in optimality give a large reduction in the number of nodes expanded? What about CPU time?

For RBFS, one can sacrifice optimality by pruning parts of the search tree. While it may not necessarily yield an optimal solution, this may yield a large reduction in the number of expanded nodes if the RBFS search considers one path down the search tree without having to backtrack and expand nodes redundantly. If one is lucky, RBFS may yield an optimal solution if parts of the search tree were pruned properly.

4. How did you come up with your heuristic evaluation functions?

5. How do the two algorithms compare in the amount of search involved and the cpu-time?

6. Do you think that either of these algorithms scale to even larger problems? What is the largest problem you could solve with the best algorithm+heuristic combination? Report the wall-clock time, CPU-time, and the number of nodes searched.

7. Is there any tradeoff between how good a heuristic is in cutting down the number of nodes and how long it took to compute? Can you quantify it?

8. Is there anything else you found that is of interest?
